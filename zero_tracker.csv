Support for research and development of renewable energy and energy storage technologies appropriate for SIDS, in particular ocean energy in line with the national strategy to develop its blue economy.

A deliberate focus on using distributed generation (e.g. household solar photovoltaics) to provide modern energy access and build resilience (adaptation co-benefits) for low-income households, with an initial target of retrofitting 3,000 low-income homes with solar PV by 2030 under the Roofs to Reefs Program.

Barbados also has different emission reduction targets based on whether or not they receive international support ( aims for 35% reduction relative to business-as-usual emissions in 2030 without international support (unconditional) and 70% reduction relative to business-as-usual emissions in 2030 conditional upon international support.)","targets also include a lot of mitigation and adaptation dimensions given that Barbados is an island nation with particular vulnerabilities to increased storminess (e,g have a reefs to roofs strategy)

for measures on the emission scopes: In preparing the NDC update, the scope of the coverage of the NDC has been extended to all categories of anthropogenic emissions in line with paragraph 31(c) by conducting a complete update of the historical energy and waste sectors emissions, as well as improvements in other sectors.

information on the extent to which measures will be applied: Since ratification of the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016, Barbados has implemented the actions and activities specified in its NDC of 28 September 2015 needed to meet its conditional commitment. The implementation experience with the 2015 NDC has generally been positive:

Decentralized solar PV installations have increased with over 2,000 independent power producers now generating 45 MW of power. Progress has also been made in deploying electric passenger vehicles and public buses (EVs).

The Sustainable Energy Investment Program (SMART FUND II), financed by an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan to the government and an investment grant from the European Union Caribbean Investment Facility (EU-CIF) provides financial and technical assistance for the preparation and retrofitting of at least 100 public buildings.

The Deployment of Cleaner Fuels and Renewable Energy project, financed by an IDB loan to the National Petroleum Corporation (NPC) and the Barbados National Oil Company Limited (BNOCL), supports the diversification of the energy mix, energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy and storage technology within the premises of the NPC and the BNOCL.

Importantly, in 2020 the first Caribbean Green Climate Fund grant to the Barbados Water Authority (BWA) financed 6.5 MW in solar/gas microturbine capacity. The project is being implemented by the Caribbean Community Climate Change Center (CCCCC) and will contribute to climate change adaptation in the water sector. The project involves a Revolving Adaptation Financing Facility to subsidize water efficiency measures for households, hotels and other businesses.

In 2019, the Fair Trading Commission established feed-in-tariffs (FITs) for renewable energy technologies up to 1 MW, and in 2020, established FITs for RE technologies up to 10 MW to replace a temporary tariff arrangement with the utility and provide stable and predictable price signals to potential investors.

Until 2018, the CHENACT project, initiated by the Caribbean Tourism Organization, the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association and the IDB supported energy audits and efficiency measures in small and medium-sized hotels enabling savings of up to 50% of water usage and 30-50 % of energy bills.

Finally, the government has made a number of policy interventions to further NDC implementation, such as the elimination in 2019 of customs duties on imported systems and equipment linked to renewable energy and the provision of several additional tax incentives.

also demonstration of mitigation ambitiion of 70% reduction in GHG emissions economy wide by 2030 will be complimented by:Support for research and development of renewable energy and energy storage technologies appropriate for SIDS, in particular ocean energy in line with the national strategy to develop its blue economy.

A deliberate focus on using distributed generation (e.g. household solar photovoltaics) to provide modern energy access and build resilience (adaptation co-benefits) for low-income households, with an initial target of retrofitting 3,000 low-income homes with solar PV by 2030 under the Roofs to Reefs Program.

The aggregation of GHG emissions has been estimated using the 100-year time-horizon global warming potential values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

The Government of Barbados will put forward legislation that specifies that all emission reduction or removal units (carbon credits) belong to the Crown, unless otherwise specified. Barbados will allow for the sale of up to 50% of any certified carbon credits generated between the period 2020 and 2030.

Private finance initiatives and partnership options have specific merit. Barbados has been promoting and engaging in the areas of:

Green and blue bonds. The first private green bond was issued in August 2019 by Williams Caribbean Capital (WCC). This BBD 3 million (USD 1.5 million) bond finances solar PV assets.

Debt for Nature Swaps, Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes;

Insurance and disaster clauses;

In July 2021, Canada submitted its updated NDC, where it strengthened its emission reduction target from a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 to at least 40-45% (Government of Canada, 2021d). The inclusion of the reference to ‘at least’ suggests that Canada may exceed this target. We calculate that this target equates to an emissions level in 2030 of 427-467 MtCO2e once the contribution from its land sector has been excluded.
https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/canada/targets/

","Canada moved last year to set a 2050 net-zero target. The nation had already committed to cut emissions by 30% by 2030, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has today announced that 40-45% will now be the goal. Canada is using a 2005 baseline.

for historical emissions- whilst not specifically included in the target, the updated NDC claims that ""Canada continually looks for ways to improve its methodologies to account for historical emissions. Adopting future methodological improvements may affect historical emissions, including 2005 emissions. This could indirectly affect the megatonnes of emissions reductions required for Canada to achieve its 2030 target. Canada will continue to publish its best accounting for its 2005 emissions in its NIRs annually.""",Yes,Schedule for regular review of measures|Information on the emission reductions expected from these measures within a certain time period,Annual reporting,Yes,Yes,"Canada is committed to reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which received Royal Assent on June 29, 2021, codified the Government of Canada’s commitment for the country to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

This legislation requires the Government of Canada to set national emissions reduction targets at five-year intervals for 2030, 2035, 2040, and 2045, and to develop emission reduction plans for each target as well as explain how each plan would contribute to reaching net-zero in 2050. The Government will engage key stakeholders and partners such as provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous Peoples, and the Net-Zero Advisory Body, among others, in setting these national targets. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified that achieving net-zero emissions by about 2050 and achieving deeper near term emission reductions by 2030 are key to limiting warming to 1.5oC. Reducing Canada’s 2030 emissions by 40-45% below 2005 levels will help preserve the remaining carbon budget and act as an important milestone to 2050. Deep emissions reductions by 2030 are required in order to build the demand and supply for net-zero emissions technologies by 2050.

The independent Net-Zero Advisory Body, an expert advisory panel, is working to recommend pathways for Canada to reach its net-zero by 2050 target. The Advisory Body will also provide advice on emissions reductions milestones leading up to 2050, and identify near-term actions and key building blocks that support this long-term target.

The government is an important player in Canada’s work to reach to net-zero emissions by 2050. Government decisions must consider climate in a rigorous, consistent, and measurable manner. These considerations include both short and long-term climate mitigation, as well as climate resilience and adaptation. This transformation will require an aligned approach that ensures that government spending and decisions support Canada’s climate goals.

Canada will continue to report on its progress through the UNFCCC National Communications every four years and National Inventory Reports every year. Canada will submit its final Biennial Report no later than December 31, 2022. Under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), Canada will submit its Biennial Transparency Report by December 31, 2024, and every two years thereafter, in accordance with the modalities, procedures and guidelines (contained in 18/CMA.1) including on progress implementing and achieving its NDC. Furthermore, federal, provincial and territorial governments have committed to jointly report on progress in implementing the PCF through annual PCF synthesis reports available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian- framework.html. The Government of Canada will also continue to report on projected emission reductions on an annual basis, and will continue to collaborate with Indigenous Peoples to design indicators that reflect Indigenous climate priorities. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act requires additional transparency measures including an emissions reduction plan, a progress report and an assessment report for each emissions reduction target it sets, as well as an annual report outlining how the Government of Canada is managing the financial risks and opportunities related to climate change.

Canadas public plan for achieving its targets is outlined in the PCF 
for example includes information like:
Canada is a world leader in zero-carbon power, generating approximately 82% of its electricity from non-emitting sources, such as water, wind, solar and nuclear. Moving forward, emphasis will be placed on ensuring that Canada is prepared for the accelerated electrification of key sectors and can meet increased demand with new sources of non-emitting electricity.

The Government of Canada will:

Require 100 % of new light-duty vehicle and passenger trucks sold in Canada to be zero- emissions by 2035, a commitment supported by pursuing a combination of supportive investments and regulations.

Invest $287 million to extend the Incentives for Zero-Emissions Vehicles program beyond its $300 million initial investment, and invest an additional $150 million in charging and refueling stations across Canada.

Work with partners, domestically and internationally, to reduce emissions from other modes of transportation, which can be challenging to abate, including heavy-duty vehicles, rail, marine, and aviation operations.

Advance the national active transportation strategy by investing $400 million for Canada’s first active transportation fund, drawn from an investment of $14.9 billion for public and active transportation, which also includes $3 billion annually in permanent public transit funding beginning in 2026-27.

Work with the United States to align with the most ambitious light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle standards whether at the state or federal level.

Invest $964 million in smart renewable energy and grid modernization projects, as well as continue to work with provinces and territories to help build key intertie projects.

Commit to powering rural, remote, northern and Indigenous communities that currently rely on diesel with clean, reliable energy by 2030.

Even though the production of renewable energies has increased steadily, rising energy demand within the country and the widely held belief that fossil fuels go hand in hand with economic development make it difficult to disengage from oil extraction. To restructure the national energy sector, energy governance to ensure the socio-economic sustainability is needed. Thus the social, economic, and environmental impacts must be assessed, and policies developed to meet regional needs. This means, of course, that the acceptance of renewable energies in society must be promoted through economic incentives such as new job opportunities, affordable electricity prices and accessible infrastructure. In addition, it is necessary and to limit damage to flora and fauna caused by renewable energy construction. The switch to cleaner energy sources will entail huge financial and administrative efforts to implement necessary technology, to adjust the existing energy infrastructure and to create institutions to help achieve emission reduction and energy efficiency. Efforts must be made on the national level as well as globally to achieve sustainable development in countries that are trying to balance resource rent dependencies, increasing energy demand, as well as achieving a national energy transition. Global energy policies could consider the needs of these countries and help improve, rather than worsen, already unequal power relations. Combating climate change should be the most important goal on the global agenda, meaning that new policy paths are required which prioritize international cooperation instead of international power struggles. The future should feature new approaches similar to the Yasuní-ITT initiative in Ecuador, which sought international payments for leaving fossil fuels in the ground, thus preserving biodiversity and globally important oxygen sources. Ecuador, like other countries dependent on fossil fuels or coal, must be supported in their quest for clean energy. Without international support, the nations’ access to a green future will be thwarted, aggravating climate change.

Following the adaptation of the European CCS Directive in 2009, the legislative framework is ready. The use of BECCS will require an adequately centralized use of biomass (in fixed facilities and therefore excluding transport), whereas bio-energy generally is more often used in small facilities in a more scattered way. Rolling out these technologies will benefit from proper integration with the regions’ economies, ideally reusing existing infrastructure and underground storage, offshore if necessary.
Uncertainties regarding these technologies, their acceptability and the availability and reliability of storage mean that their development must be carefully considered and based on the definition of a viable economic model combined with good long-term risk management. That being said, it is most likely that it is an essential option for the future, as it allows for the generation of continuous negative emissions over the very long term (with forest storage eventually reaching an optimum level, draining carbon sinks in a few decades/centuries). Direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere is also an option, but it is still in the very early stages of research and development.",Climate Ambition Alliance,3424151722750,,64531444,,,,,352100000,2019,

commitments.","Our intended contributions are presented below.
Forestry i) Unconditional contributions
Guyana is willing to continue making the following contributions unconditionally:
7
Continue and improve ongoing work to realize sustainable forest management. GFC
will ensure compliance with the various Codes of Practice that govern the timber
industry using local resources.
Forest monitoring will maintain a high level of timber legality, with the GFC
committing 50% of its staff to field monitoring from its 54 forest monitoring stations
countrywide. These efforts will maintain a low rate of illegal logging (at less than 2% of
production).
Guyana is also prepared to finalize and implement the Voluntary Partnership
Agreement (VPA) under EU- FLEGT. The VPA is expected to be finalized in 2016 and to
provide independent accreditation of forest legality and management practices
throughout Guyana‟s timber industry.
We are prepared to improve added- value activities locally to assist in creating a
higher potential for carbon storage in long-use wood products. This could also
potentially reduce the pressure on forest resources as derivation of a higher value
may result in reduced harvest levels.
Indigenous people own and manage some 14% of Guyana‟s lands. The culture and
traditions of Guyana‟s indigenous peoples are rooted in sustainable use of nature,
evident in the forests and other natural ecosystems maintained through centuries on
the lands they have customarily occupied and used. Guyana will strengthen its
support for indigenous communities as they continue the stewardship of their lands
and inter alia the benefits that accrue from any REDD+ activities from these lands.
If they choose to, communities will be supported to better manage their transition to
more market-based means of provisioning for their social and cultural well-being in
ways that continue the tradition of wise use. Indigenous peoples themselves, through
the full application of the FPIC process, in keeping with the stated policy in the
LCDS, will decide whether or not to include their titled lands as part of Guyana‟s
REDD+ programme. Policies will also be implemented to reflect equity between the
extractive sector and indigenous peoples as the nation moves to genuinely ensure
that the fight against climate change continues.
ii) Conditional Contributions
Avoided Deforestation
Guyana‟s proposal for a Reference Level for REDD+ is based on the Combined
Reference Level approach, in which a global forest carbon emissions loss of 0.44%, as
concluded by Baccini et. al. 2012 is used, along with Guyana‟s historic emissions level
for the period 2000 to 2009 (0.06%) as established in the GNA. Using a total carbon
stock of forests in aboveground and belowground biomass of 19,197,411,268 tCO2e,
Guyana‟s Proposed Reference Level for its REDD+ Programme is 48.7 MtCO2e. Through
this approach, Guyana can continue to avoid emissions in the amount of 48.7 MtCO2e
annually if adequate incentives are provided.
8
To contribute to avoided deforestation and achieve an effective REDD+ programme,
Guyana will implement policies measures, and incentive programmes, to engender
broader participation of civil society and the private sector in actions to avoid
deforestation and forest degradation. The Guyana Government is cognizant of the need
for comprehensive land use planning in order to efficiently management and rationally
exploit our national resources.
In summary, avoided emissions contributions resulting from reforms in the timber and
mining industries can contribute up to 48.7 MtCO2e to the global mitigation effort
through the implementation of the Emission Reduction Programme described in greater
detail below.
Emission Reduction Programme for Forests
Given that the bulk of Guyana‟s emissions emanate from mining and logging activities,
our Emissions Reductions Programme (ERP) will therefore focus on making these
industries more efficient and compliant with our targets. With adequate resources,
Guyana will develop a suite of ERP measures that will include:
- the conservation of an additional 2 million hectares through Guyana‟s
National Protected Area System and other effective area -based conservation
measures as per Guyana‟s commitment under the UNCBD, including the
protection of conservancies and reservoirs and their watersheds and the
watersheds upstream of new hydro-power sites. Existing mangrove forests
will be counted in this target and the mangrove restoration programme along
the vulnerable coast will be expanded.
Timber harvesting contributed 40% of Guyana‟s emissions from land use between
2001 and 2012. In the timber industry the ERP will:
• Use of Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). Reducing the incidental and
collateral damage during tree felling by about 10% and the damage from skid
trails by about 35% (avoiding mid-size trees during skidding), could reduce the
annual emissions by 13.5%. This translates to a reduction of about 430,000
tCO2 per year.
This will result in a reduction of the annual emissions from the timber industry
from 3.5M tCO2 to 2.3M tCO2, a 20% reduction from historic levels for this
driver, and an 11% reduction in the overall historic level.
• Guyana is in the process of reviewing compliance of significant timber
concession agreements with a view to determining if they meet agreed targets. 
9
A wider review to determine the most optimal use of these lands will be
undertaken. If, in fact, REDD+ can provide adequate incentives, Guyana would
be prepared to reduce the area to be logged in favour of conservation
concessions and to further the development of non-timber forest products and
other forest-based services while recognizing the need for livelihoods.
Our MRVS has verified that small scale gold mining resulted in 89% of the deforestation
recorded in Guyana over the past three years. To address this, the ERP will include
actions by the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC) to implement policy
reforms, education, and incentives for integrated planning and management of the
mining sector. This will support the transformation of the mining sector by 2020 and
include actions to:
• Implement mineral mapping in the mining districts to identify
economically exploitable deposits. This will significantly reduce deforestation
by avoiding clearing of forest cover from lands which contain only marginal
mineral deposits. A significant portion of Guyana‟s deforestation results from
forest clearing for mining that does not generate a profit.
• Implement awareness and incentive programmes to improve the
efficiency of technologies and practices in the mining industry. This will
include replacing inefficient mercury-based technology with more efficient
technologies, such as shaker-tables and centrifuge systems that can increase
gold recovery rates from 30% to 80%. Currently, low recovery rates cause
miners to often return to previously mined areas when technology or
economic circumstances favour them doing so. Improved recovery efficiency
would make reprocessing of sites unnecessary and better facilitate costeffective reforestation and recovery of mined sites.
• Implement policies to institute mandatory, nation-wide land
reclamation and reforestation of mined areas.

Forest Governance
Guyana has made significant progress in complying with EU-FLEGT for our timber
exports to the European Union. Additional resources are required to build institutional
and private sector capacity to meet other trade and supply conditions such as the Lacey
Act, FSC certification and other procurement requirements.
MRVS
A comprehensive and robust MRV system, one of the most advanced of its kind, has
been developed under Guyana‟s REDD+ programme. The development of this system
has contributed considerably to the global understanding of how small forested tropical
countries can reliably and cost-effectively measure and report on its forest carbon 
10
emissions. Guyana is willing to build on the lessons learnt thus far to complete and
maintain its MRVS if adequate financial resources are provided to do so.
Implementation cost
The cost of implementation of these forest-conservation initiatives in total is estimated
to be determined annually.
Energy
Unconditional Contributions
Guyana is in the process of reviewing our options toward the rapid expansion of a
renewable energy supply. Our goal is to develop a mix of wind, solar, biomass and
hydropower to supply both the demand of the national grid and the energy
requirements for towns and villages in Guyana‟s hinterland.
Guyana will seek to construct and/or promote the construction of small hydro systems
at suitable locations such as Moco Moco, Kato and Tumatumari. Guyana will power all
of the six newly established townships, starting with Bartica, using renewable energy
sources. Currently, Guyana has installed cogeneration from bagasse to power sugar
mills. Independent power producers and suppliers are being encouraged to construct
energy farms and sell energy to the national grid. Preliminary approvals have been given
for a 26MW wind farm.
The Government of Guyana will continue to work closely with farmers in agricultural
areas across Guyana to encourage the use of bio-digesters to reduce waste, produce
biogas and provide affordable, healthy and efficient cooking means at the household
level.
Legislation has been enacted to remove import duty and tax barriers for the importation
of renewable energy equipment, compact fluorescent lamps and LED lamps to
incentivize and motivate energy efficient behavior. Guyana will continue to conduct
energy audits and replace inefficient lighting at public, residential and commercial
buildings to reduce energy consumption. Public education and awareness programmes
will continue to play a major role in providing consumers with information and tools to
reduce energy consumption and expenditure. Guyana will implement other policies to
encourage energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, including building codes
and net-metering of residential renewable power.
We expect that these unconditional contributions will significantly reduce Guyana‟s
energy consumption.
Conditional Contributions
Guyana is committed to eliminating our near complete dependence on fossil fuels.
Given our solar, wind and hydropower potential and relatively small national demand, 
11
we believe that with adequate and timely financial support, Guyana can develop a 100%
renewable power supply by 2025. Assessment of the potential of the renewable power
sources will be undertaken to determine the most cost effective and efficient means of
developing this potential; to this end an independent review of the Amaila Falls Project
is to be undertaken with the assistance of the Kingdom of Norway.","Other URLs

Mexico has been seen as a leader in the subject https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mexico-approves-landmark-climate-law/   He is often described as a climate leader among the poorest countries. However, as one study states : ""Mexico's climate leadership consists mostly of promises and the adoption of legislation, but its actions have not yet modified its greenhouse gas emissions.""López Obrador has financed the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and slowed the rise of private renewable energy projects in favor of energy self-sufficiency based on fossil fuels.
In addition, he has cut the budget of the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources as part of a government austerity program and has criticized environmental NGOs in Mexico for their alleged links with foreign governments.

As a result of all this, Bloomberg has affirmed that the Mexican president has the ""rare distinction of being a leader with leftist roots whose environmental policy is closer to the deniers of the right-wing climate.

Myanmar has not yet adopted an economy wide emission reductions target. Nevertheless, Myanmar has increased the number of target sectors from the two indicated in the INDC (Forestry and Energy) to five and has identified a number of additional priority sectors that it would like to seek support in the future. In the current socio-economic context, as the country is still in the process of developing is basic infrastructure, and with the need to stimulate economic growth, Myanmar‟s emissions are expected to peak during this NDC period as investments materialize in the county.

Togo's greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 (baseline year) represented just 0.05% of total emissions worldwide. 
Togo commits to limit temperature rise to 2°C by 2030. Togo implemented activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially in the energy, agriculture and LULUCF (land use, land-use change and forestry) sectors. 

In terms of road transport, the planned actions aim to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in Togo by 20% over the course of the period under review, by improving the road system, promoting the use of public transport, reducing the average age of imported vehicles (to 5-7 years) and promoting active modes of transport (bicycles, walking, bike paths).

Equity:
Togo is a small country that emits almost no GHGs and so has virtually no responsibility in terms of global warming. Through its INDC, Togo proposes to focus on carbon-lean sustainable development, by encouraging sustainable practices, whereas the easy solution would simply be to continue using fossil fuels while they are still available.
According to the IPCC, the estimated worldwide GHG emissions for 2010 totalled roughly 40,000 Mt of CO2e. The emissions from the Republic of Togo for the same year were estimated at 20.45 Mt of CO2e, representing about 0.05% of the total volume. The emissions are non-significant compared with worldwide emissions.

Statement on “Fair and Ambitious”: Tonga is one of the most at-risk countries in the world in terms of its exposure to the unfolding effects of climate change. The need for Tonga to invest large portions of its public service capacity in the ambitious quest to achieve climate resilience objectives is a consequence of the emissions of other large countries.

Equity: Trinidad and Tobago is a small island developing state with limited technological, technical, financial and human resources and a small economy. The country accounts for under 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change. Notwithstanding, the government places importance on mitigation and adaptation because it recognises the need for developing a low carbon economy to achieve sustainable development objectives. To this end, Trinidad and Tobago began to put in place the policy and legislative framework and commits to unconditional mitigation action.

Currently, 50% of electricity is derived from renewables, mainly solar, and this figure will rise to 100% by 2025. This would mean almost zero use of fossil fuel for power generation. This is in line with the ambition to keep the warming to less than 1.5 degrees C.
Generate electricity with 100% renewable energy by 2020. Increase energy efficiency on Funafuti by 30%.
Electricity will be generated using renewable energy in all the nine islands of Tuvalu. The Outer Islands are being developed as a priority.
1000 Solar Roof Programme: about half of the current roof space of the buildings in Funafuti will be occupied by photovoltaic arrays. 
Equity: Tuvalu’s emissions are less than 0.000005% of global emissions. 2015 showed decline in emissions due to the installation of solar PV systems.
Tuvalu is the world’s second lowest-lying country and sea level rise poses a risk to its existence. Climate change through rising temperatures and irregular rainfall impact income from fish and crops. In this context, the target of zero dependence on important fossil fuels for electricity generation by 2025 cannot be more ambitious. Moreover, targets to reduce emissions from the other energy sectors, mainly transport, are significant given that this is a rapidly growing source of carbon emissions.

Democratic senators have quoted the possibility for a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030 (from a 2005 baseline), with the Rhodium group giving similar estimates of 32%-42%, Energy Innovation 37-41%, and 42% according to the REPEAT project based at Princeton University. The climate action tracker estimates a wider potential range of emissions cut
 by 2030 (26 to 42% relative to 2005 levels). bHence, although expected emissions reductions are not included within the actual target plan, this represents a real and tangible impact on future emissions.

Equity statement - ""As a developing country, in line with the principles of equity, as well as common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, our ability to respond to climate change is likely to be far slower than our developed world counterparts. In view of this latter point, we would like to reiterate that effective responses to climate change can be accomplished with appropriate financial, technological, and capacity-building support from the developed world in line with their corresponding obligations to provide such support. South Africa received in excess of 4 billion US dollars in financial support from bilateral and multilateral sources towards climate change action. It is worth noting, with concern, that the majority of reported financial climate support has not been in the form of grants, but mostly in the form of loans. Be that as it may, South Africa remains committed to doing its best to combat climate change through various measures, drawing on the much appreciated capacity-building, technical and financial support of developed countries.""

 Australia adopts a target of net zero emissions by 2050 or as soon as possible. This is an economy-wide target, covering all sectors and gases included in Australia’s national inventory.
 In order to achieve net zero by 2050, Australia commits to seven low emissions
technology stretch goals - ambitious but realistic goals to bring priority low emissions
technologies to economic parity with existing mature technologies.
 Australia reaffirms its ambitious economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse emissions

points. Australia’s emissions projections 2021 demonstrate that we are on track to
reduce emissions by up to 35% below 2005 levels by 2030.

The Plan focuses on technology. The Technology Investment Roadmap is the cornerstone of the plan, and prioritises technologies that will help Australia cut emissions while creating jobs and growing our economy.

The Plan outlines how we will:

drive down the cost of low emissions technologies
deploy these technologies at scale
help our regional industries and communities seize economic opportunities in new and traditional markets
work with other countries on the technologies needed to decarbonise the world’s economy.
These actions will get Australia to net zero emissions by 2050 without jeopardising our economy, jobs, prosperity or way of life.","Australia first communicated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement in 2015, committing to an ambitious economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.
Australia’s 2030 target will take the form of an emissions budget for the period 2021 to 2030. The emissions budget is calculated by taking a linear decline from 2020 to 2030, beginning from Australia’s 2020 target of 5 per cent below 2000 levels and finishing at 26 per cent and 28 per cent below 2005 levels in 2030. https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Australia%20First/Australia%20NDC%20recommunication%20FINAL.PDF","Our Plan is based on five key principles, with an enabling role for government. These
principles are:
1. Technology not taxes – no new costs for households or businesses,
2. Expand choices, not mandates – we will work to expand consumer choice, both
domestically and with our trading partners,
3. Drive down the cost of a range of new energy technologies – bringing a
portfolio of technologies to parity is the objective of Australia’s Technology
Investment Roadmap,
4. Keep energy prices down with affordable and reliable power – our Plan will
consolidate our advantage in affordable and reliable energy, protecting the
competitiveness of our industries and the jobs they support, and
5. Be accountable for progress – transparency is essential to converting ambition
into achievement. Australia will continue to set ambitious yet achievable wholeof-economy goals, then beat them, consistent with our approach to our Kyotoera and Paris Agreement targets.

By this submission, Australia communicates its updated and enhanced first Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.
 Australia adopts a target of net zero emissions by 2050. This is an economy-wide
target, covering all sectors and gases included in Australia’s national inventory.
 In order to achieve net zero by 2050, Australia commits to seven low emissions
technology stretch goals - ambitious but realistic goals to bring priority low emissions
technologies to economic parity with existing mature technologies.
 Australia reaffirms its ambitious economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse emissions

points. Australia’s emissions projections 2021 demonstrate that we are on track to
reduce emissions by up to 35% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Sectors covered are: Energy; Industrial processes and product use; Agriculture; Land-use, Land-use change and forestry (UNFCCC classifications); Waste 

metrics used: Australia intends to apply 100 year Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) as contained in inventory reporting guidelines, currently IPCC Fifth Assessment Report 100 year GWPs, or as otherwise agreed.

Australia will apply the IPCC 2006 Guidelines, or subsequent version or refinement as agreed by the CMA, and nationally appropriate methods consistent with that guidance and informed inter alia by the IPCC 2019 Refinement and IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement.



Additional information about what emissions the target covers - Australia will account based on UNFCCC inventory reporting sectors using a net-net approach across all sectors. Australia will apply the natural disturbance provision in reporting net emissions from infrequent, extreme wildfires in temperate forests, which are beyond control despite the extensive efforts of emergency management organisations. Australia will report total national net emissions with and without the natural disturbance provision. Australia will apply the stock-change approach to reporting and accounting emissions from harvested wood products. https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Australia%20First/Australia%20NDC%20recommunication%20FINAL.PDF",Yes,"Measures for all emission scopes that are covered by the target|Information on the emission reductions expected from these measures within a certain time period|Schedule for regular review of measures|Information on the extent to which measures will be applied (e.g. if switching to EVs, what share of the fleet; if installing an own solar PV installation, what is the installed capacity)",Annual reporting,Yes,Yes,"The Australian government's Climate Change Authority (CCA)  conducts and comission independent research and analysis but also undertakes reviews and recommendations as requested by ministers.

""Emissions reduction targets must go hand-in-hand with real outcomes. Australia has a strong track record of setting emissions reduction targets that are both ambitious and achievable, and of holding ourselves accountable for exceeding them. Australia met and exceeded its first and second commitment period targets under the Kyoto Protocol and its 2020 target under the Convention. We are on track to overachieve against our 2030 target.""

""Transparency is essential to convert ambition into achievement. Australia will be accountable for progress under our Plan, setting the global benchmark for transparency and accountability in our emissions reporting. Globally, Australia will continue to advocate for all major economies to be held to the same high standards of transparency.""

accounting for emissions and removals: Australia will account for its 2050 target on the basis of total net national emissions reported in its National Inventory Document for the year 2050, submitted under the Paris Agreement

Equity comment - ""Australia’s Nationally Determined Contribution is an ambitious, fair and responsible contribution to global efforts toward meeting the objective 
of the UNFCCC with the goal of limiting global average temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius""

updated: ""Five core principles guided the development of our Plan and Australia’s suite of emissions reduction policies. Taken together, these principles will ensure Australia’s shift to a net zero emissions economy will be effective, fair and equitable, and that no sector of the economy will carry a disproportionate burden.""

3.1.2: Fairness considerations including reflecting on equity; Australia’s plan focuses not only on reducing our own emissions, but also on how Australia will support the transition pathways of partner countries, through our low emissions energy exports and contributions to innovation, and the development of low emissions technologies. Australia will continue to supply energy exports that our trading partners need to maintain their economic prosperity. Australia’s technology stretch goals will contribute to making low emissions technologies accessible, affordable and globally scalable, to ensure economic growth, prosperity and emissions reductions can go hand in hand for all countries.""

on reviewing: ""Australia will also conduct regular reviews of the impacts of our policies on our regions, energy prices, jobs and other economic indicators. Under the Technology Investment Roadmap, Australia will also report annually on progress towards the technology stretch goals and the investments the Government is making to support their achievement.""

types of review include: Paris Agreement Review and refine cycle,  Low Emissions Technology statements and Emissions Reduction Policy Impact assessments

Plan includes examples of measures being taken, such as ""Future Fuels Package [which] will enable businesses to start integrating new vehicle technologies into their fleets, and address blackspots in public charging and refuelling infrastructure."", but these are often funds or programmes that lack specific measures, targets and emission reduction expectations.

Solutions seem to be very technology focused.

Source for information about reporting - https://www.industry.gov.au/policies-and-initiatives/australias-climate-change-strategies/tracking-and-reporting-greenhouse-gas-emissions 
additionally - Each year, Australia’s national emissions are published disaggregated to the sub-national level (state and territory) and by industry. National emissions estimates are updated every quarter in the Quarterly Update of the Australian national greenhouse gas inventory. This is in addition to submitting its national greenhouse gas inventory to the UNFCCC. These data are made publicly available via an interactive database known as the Australian Greenhouse Emissions Information System to promote transparency and encourage public scrutiny. https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Australia%20First/Australia%20NDC%20recommunication%20FINAL.PDF",Yes,No conditions specified,,,No,Yes (nature-based and CCS-based removals),"CCS is listed as a priority in the Technology Investment Roadmap and Low Emissions Technology Statement. In 2021, AUD 263.9m was directed towards CCS. The government's Low Emissions Technology Statement specifies the government's technology investment priorities and supports gas and CCS. 
The ERF allows the government to purchase low-cost abatement (Ausrtalian carbon credit units) to provide incentives to business and households to reduce their emissions. 

Enhancing carbon levels in soils offers huge potential to improve the uptake of carbon emissions across the globe. Australia is a world leader in this area and will be sharing its expertise with other countries. - https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/Summary%20Report%20Australias%202030%20Emission%20Reduction%20Target.pdf

in the updated NDC report- Carbon capture and storage – CO2 compression, hub transport and storage under $20/t of CO2 as well as soil carbon measurements under $3/ha/year

""Carbon capture and storage: The $20 per tonne of CO₂ stretch goal covers CO2 compression, hub transport and storage, but does not cover capture processes, noting the cost of capture technologies varies between applications and depends on factors such as the relative concentration of CO2 for different industrial processes. The stretch goal assumes CO₂ is transported within a hub distance of less than 100 km to suitable reservoirs. Achieving a stretch goal of under $20 per tonne would position CCS to be competitive over the long term with other forms of abatement supported by Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund. Under a high technology scenario, CCS could be deployed as early as 2025, subject to securing offtake agreements and development approvals.""

soil carbon- ""Soil carbon measurement: The soil carbon measurement stretch goal time range was set based on consultations with industry. Based on a high technology uptake scenario, advancements in proximal sensing, simulation modelling and remote sensing technologies could see the stretch goal of under $3 per hectare per year reached as early as 2025. As of 2020, soil carbon measurement for Emissions Reduction Fund projects were estimated at around $30 per hectare per year (CSIRO estimates based on a land area of 300 hectares; estimates could be lower for larger areas).""

""Achievement of Australia’s priority technology stretch goals will have a significant impact on global emissions. The five technologies first identified in Australia’s first low emissions technology statement (2020) (hydrogen, energy storage, low emissions materials, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon measurement) address emissions in sectors that account for 90 per cent of global emissions, or around 45 billion tonnes CO2-e annually. Australia is targeting international partnerships that support these economic stretch goals, including access to global markets and more competitive supply chains. We are also prioritising partnerships that focus on critical research, development and deployment challenges for economically important, hard-to-abate sectors."" 

so as mentioned above, there is a strong emphasis on technology stretch goals to have an impact on global emissions.









also discusses offsets and sinks in terms of Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples, in a gender-responsive manner; The five yearly review process will allow Australia to take stock of our progress towards our net zero target. This will ensure our policies are calibrated to reflect the latest technology advances, international developments and other factors. It will ensure there is transparency regarding how progress is tracked, including any updates or revisions, achievements and effectiveness of key national policies and investments, as well as the role of state and territory policies and targets in contributing to the national goal. It will enable Australia to balance its investments across domestic offsets, international offsets and pursuing technological breakthroughs).

are received by target beneficiaries.",2030,In policy document,2017,No target,,,,,,,,,"The key for Egypt to mitigate GHGs emissions is to provide appropriate foundations for
the development of low carbon energy systems.
Pathways to achieving high CO2 mitigation levels comprise the following:
 Widespread diffusion of locally-appropriate low-carbon energy production
technologies, with substantial reductions in energy intensity
 Comprehensive mitigation efforts covering all major sources of emissions
 Locally-appropriate technology transfer and financial flows from industrialized
countries (Annex I countries) to support carbon emission abatement according
to the UNFCCC principles, which acknowledges that developed countries should
provide required support to developing countries in this regard.
Policies targeting development that is more sustainable rely upon five main pillars:
1. More efficient use of energy, especially by end users;
2. Increased use of renewable energy as an alternative to non-renewable energy

3. Use of advanced locally-appropriate and more-efficient fossil fuel technologies,

The degree to which efficiency improvements can limit energy demand growth is one
of the main distinguishing characteristics of greenhouse gas reduction pathways.
Energy efficiency could be improved radically through a combination of behavioral
changes and rapid introduction of stringent efficiency regulations, technology
standards, and environmental externality pricing, which mitigates rebound effects.
Renewable energy technologies, which are relevant to the local context, will play a very
important role in reducing GHG emissions, but they would not suffice to keep climate
change manageable. However, renewable energy may provide a number of
opportunities since it also addresses sustainable and equitable economic development,
energy access, secure energy supply, and reduced local environmental and health
impacts. ",,"The primary focus of the NDC is the adaptation component.

The Government has launched many schemes and programs to scale up India’s actions on both adaptation and mitigation. Appropriate measures are being taken under these schemes and programs across many sectors, including water, agriculture, forest, energy and enterprise, sustainable mobility and housing, waste management, circular economy and resource efficiency, etc. As a result of the aforesaid measures, India has progressively continued decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions.

Similarly, India’s massive LED bulb campaign is reducing emissions by 40 million tonnes annually.

""We are mobilizing for this global challenge, producing technological solutions and undertaking to achieve this important goal.""","Since then, Israel has undertaken steps to increase its ambition. Most noteworthy is Government Decision 171 passed on the 25th of July 2021 entitled ""Transition to a Low Carbon Economy.”
Unlike Israel's original NDC, this new Decision includes an unconditional absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goal for 2030 of 27% relative to 2015 and an unconditional absolute GHG emissions reduction goal for 2050 of 85% relative to 2015. 
Whereas our INDC submitted in 2015 projected 2030 emissions would be 81.65 MtCO2e, under this update they are projected to be 58 MtCO2e by 2030.
This updated goal significantly improves upon Israel's first NDC which was presented as a per capita economy-wide unconditional GHG reduction. The previous target was 7.7 tCO2e by 2030 which corresponded to a total of 81.6 MtCO2e. The updated target presented in this NDC is 58 MtCO2e, which corresponds to a reduction of 23 MtCO2e or 29% in Israel' s total emissions. 
We believe that this updated NDC is a marked improvement both in the process by which the 2030 and 2050 national and sectoral goals were determined; in the more ambitious mitigation goal and in the work carried out to increase preparedness and adaptation to Climate Change.

Between 2010 and 2018, Nigeria’s GHG emissions increased by 40% to reach 347 MtCO2eq. The baseline projection has been updated too, estimating GHG emissions at 453 MtCO2eq by 2030, i.e. around half the 2015 estimates and a 31% increase in total GHG emissions between 2018 and 2030 (+2.6%/year).

At the moment, there is no defined roadmap for its implementation.

Plan to estimate the emissions generated by nitrogen from agricultural residues returned to soils and the product emissions of mineralized nitrogen resulting from the loss in the organic carbon stock of mineral soils.

There was an increase in the net absorptions of CO2 that changed the country's GHG emissions and removals profile, going from a purely emitting country to a sink country from 1994 to 2013.

The results of the 2020 National Inventories Report of greenhouse gases from 1994 to 2017 categorise Panama as a carbon sink country. National emissions are offset by the forest cover in the national territory due to the annual increase in the carbon stocks of secondary forests.

Promoting environmental sustainability, climate-resilient communities and appropriate land use has been identified as a critical enabler that will complement the eight strategic priorities of the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2018–2021 (South Sudan Ministry of Finance and Planning 2018)","As part of South Sudan’s increased ambition, this second NDC has also increased the country’s sectoral coverage, and instituted additional mitigation and adaptation measures in sectors that were included in the first NDC. These strategies have been designed to ensure that South Sudan adopts a sustainable and low-carbon growth pathway while also supporting the country’s vision to ‘transition from a least developed country to a middle-income country by 2030 supported by inclusive, stable and sustainable economic growth whilst alleviating poverty’. ","South Sudan's second NDC aims to increase the number of sectors covered in emission reductions, especially energy and emission-intensive sectors such as petroleum and mining, has carried out a detailed exercise to identify and prioritise the top 14 sectors that would have significant impacts on South Sudan's economic and low carbon future.

""GHG emissions: A gradual increase of GHG emissions has been observed over the years in South Sudan, from both a domestic production and resource consumption perspective. Emissions due to domestic production and resource consumption have been increasing at rates of 1.22 percent and 1.14 percent per annum, respectively. The slow rise in GHG emissions over the years parallels South Sudan’s slow economic and population growth. GHG emissions from domestic production are mostly from the agriculture and livestock sector, followed by the petroleum and service sectors.

accountability- ""this November 2021 version is a draft which will be shared with the public so
it can be further crafted and co-developed to be responsive to regional, local and
personal needs. Our hope is that collaborative refinement will instil a greater sense of
accountability and buy-in, leading to rapid implementation through shifts in decision
making by government departments and its private sector partners. Some of the
actions and targets identified in the document will be specific to Western Cape
Government departments, but others will require external implementation support.""

the governance actions or responses that will be taken as a result of the document also include an accountability platform to government and a climate assembly.

""Our landscape and natural environment is one of our greatest national assets and has a vital role to play in meeting our ambitious climate change targets. Through significant increases in forestry and widespread peatland restoration in particular, we can reduce greenhouse gases and other pollutants and increase the levels of carbon dioxide being absorbed and locked up in timber products. We will continue to expand forest cover in Scotland, building on the success of creating 22,000 hectares of new woodlands in the last two years. We will increase new woodland creation from the current target level of 12,000 hectares annually in 2020/21 up to 18,000 hectares in 2024/25. Scottish Forestry and Forestry and Land Scotland will work with investors, carbon buyers, landowners and market intermediaries to increase private investment in new woodlands in order to increase the woodland carbon market by at least 50% by 2025. As of March 2020 over 25,000 hectares of peatland have been put on the road to restoration, and earlier this year we announced a £250 million ten-year funding package to support the restoration of 250,000 hectares of degraded peat by 2030. To deliver on the 2032 emissions reduction envelope annual peatland restoration needs to be far higher than the current 20,000 hectare annual target and we will work closely with delivery partners, land owners, managers, farmers and crofters to continue to encourage more restoration of peatland, both traditional bog but also land that offers the highest emission savings per hectare.""

In fiscal year 2018, the Saitama ETS achieved a 29% reduction in emissions below base- year emissions.
In April 2020, the Saitama ETS entered its third compliance period (FY2020-2024), which requires facilities to reduce emissions by 20% or 22% below baseline emissions, depending on their category.
The ‘Zero Carbon Saitama’ initiative was announced in 2018 and includes cooperation with the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee to fully offset the GHG emissions from
the (postponed) Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. As part of this initiative, companies may donate excess credits from the ETS. Companies that do not possess credits but still wish to make donations may purchase credits from larger facilities within the ETS. Credit donations to the program closed in September 2020.",,https://www.pref.saitama.lg.jp/documents/25652/actionplan_2nd_full.pdf,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,,,,,,No,,No,,No reporting mechanism,No,Not Specified,,Not Specified,,,,No,Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,41090000,2018,No

* Carbon neutrality: achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by having a balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon emissions 
** Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G): a global platform, joined by government agencies, businesses and civil society, that aims to respond to climate change and achieve sustainable development goals as a converged organization in the 21st century 

As the first Breakout Session to be held during the Green Future Week* in the lead up to the 2021 P4G Seoul Summit on May 30-31, the event is designed to discuss the roles and action plan for achieving global carbon neutrality, centering on local governments that are the key players of carbon neutrality.
* Green Future Week (May 24-29): 10 Green Future Sessions on carbon neutrality of local governments, Green New Deal, green technology, forests, etc.  

Representatives of local governments, businesses, civil society and international organizations from around the globe will seek actions of local governments at home and abroad to achieve carbon neutrality and present better alternatives to build back better and greener.

【Key Participants】
▸ Opening Ceremony: Jeon Hae-cheol (Minister of the Interior and Safety), Han Jeoung-ae (Minister of Environment), Ban Ki-moon (President of the Assembly and Chair of the Council of the Global Green Growth Institute), Kate Raworth (Co-founder of Doughnut Economics Action Lab)

In order to tackle climate change, 226 Korean local governments recognized the state of climate emergency and adopted the Declaration of Climate Emergency in June last year to urge the national government and the National Assembly to declare their commitment to carbon neutrality. 

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. 

And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. 

With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. 

Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” 

“The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

limiting global warming to 2°C was carried out. These
targets also reflect the state's commitments as a member
of the Under2 Coalition. Based on this assessment, the
state of Quintana Roo selected the following state-level
GHG reduction targets consistent with the levels of
emissions required to achieve the goal of limiting global
warming to 2°C:
By 2030, 21% reduction of GHG emissions below 2016
emissions level.
• By 2050, 63% reduction of GHG emissions below 2016
emissions level.",,"Many initiatives and actions but no targets.

Section 30 states that international aviation and shipping are not included. However this has since been updated in the 6th Carbon Budget: ""In line with the recommendation from the independent Climate Change Committee, this sixth Carbon Budget limits the volume of greenhouse gases emitted over a 5-year period from 2033 to 2037, taking the UK more than three-quarters of the way to reaching net zero by 2050. The Carbon Budget will ensure Britain remains on track to end its contribution to climate change while remaining consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal to limit global warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts towards 1.5°C. For the first time, this Carbon Budget will incorporate the UK’s share of international aviation and shipping emissions – an important part of the government’s decarbonisation efforts that will allow for these emissions to be accounted for consistently."" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-enshrines-new-target-in-law-to-slash-emissions-by-78-by-2035 

https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/net-zero-target states that ""The Climate Change Act 2008 requires the government to set five-yearly carbon budgets, after taking advice from the CCC. [...]The budgets are fixed in advance and set five-year caps on the total greenhouse gas emissions allowed to ensure the UK meets its emissions reductions commitments."" with the 6th Carbon budget being ""the first to take the net-zero target into account""

The amount of greenhouse gas removal or emissions possible from the UK’s natural environment is dependent on how the UK uses its land and the land’s condition. In 2017, an estimated 28 million tonnes of CO2 and other carbon gases were removed by vegetation in the UK3. Such removals are included and netted off against the UK’s GHG emissions in the Climate Change Act definition of how GHG emissions are measured. However, potential GHG emissions from some areas of the UK’s natural environment that are not in good condition are currently excluded from the definition.

* Sakhalin region to test Russia's first carbon market

* Net-zero plan far more ambitious than national goals

* Renewable energy and cleaner transport set for a boost

By Angelina Davydova

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fossil fuel-rich Russia may not be known as a leader on climate action - but in the country's remote far east, authorities have launched an unexpected experiment: an effort to try out carbon trading and reach net-zero planet-heating emissions by 2025.

The government of the Russian island region of Sakhalin, in the Pacific Ocean north of Japan, is planning tax breaks, charging stations and dedicated parking lots for electric vehicles, alongside a ban on all petrol and diesel cars by 2035.

Coal-fired power plants will be replaced with somewhat cleaner natural gas and hydrogen-fuelled passenger train lines developed in the region the size of Ireland, Sakhalin officials said, after their net-zero roadmap was approved by Moscow.

The Russian government - which has been criticised by green groups and analysts for setting unambitious climate action goals - in January gave a green light to Sakhalin's proposal for a pilot carbon emissions trading scheme, a first for the country.

The economy of the Sakhalin region, home to about half a million people, is largely based on fossil-fuel extraction, including coal.

According to its net-zero plan, an inventory of Sakhalin's greenhouse gas emissions and natural carbon sequestration potential will be carried out by August, before setting up an emissions trading system to start operating in mid-2022.

""This experiment will allow us to try various measures to regulate carbon and evaluate their effectiveness, for later scaling up at the national level,"" Russia's Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said in an official statement.

""We hope that investors interested in 'green' projects, and companies willing to take on more ambitious climate targets, will be motivated to participate in the experiment,"" he added.

Sakhalin Deputy Prime Minister Vyacheslav Alenkov told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the region had taken the lead on the initiative, hoping to increase its investment appeal, improve quality of life and help solve environmental problems.

Besides emissions trading and expanding electric mobility, the region also wants to swap coal for lower-emitting natural gas, develop blue and green hydrogen production, and promote sustainable management of its extensive taiga forests.

About 97% of all coal mined there is currently exported, and coal could remain a reserve fuel for Sakhalin, if technologies were introduced to make the industry cleaner, Alenkov said.

ISLAND RENEWABLES?

As well as boosting gas for transport and homes - used now by about one-third of residents - there are plans to develop renewable energy, especially on the Kuril Islands, he added.

As the mountainous Sakhalin region is made up of nearly 90 islands, it is suitable for small-scale hydro, wind and solar power as well as geothermal energy, sources that are still under-developed but could improve energy access, Alenkov said.

An assessment of the opportunities for renewable solutions, including the technologies and funding needed, is due to yield its first results this year and investors are already interested, he added.

Sakhalin also hopes to develop cooperation with other emissions trading systems, including China, Japan and perhaps the European Union, and have its carbon credits approved for the international airline CORSIA offsetting scheme, Alenkov said.

Georgy Safonov, a climate policy researcher at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, said Sakhalin had high potential for bioenergy and renewables, urging the authorities to craft more robust plans for clean energy including green hydrogen, as well as to expand electric transport and forest carbon sinks.

NATIONAL AMBITION LOW

Vladimir Chuprov, head of Greenpeace Russia's energy programme, said Russia was 10 to 15 years behind global trends in regulating carbon emissions.

""It is only now we are getting to what many other countries have already realised,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

But as Russia's national emissions target does not require any real reductions, it will be difficult to build a nationwide carbon market due to a lack of demand for offsets, he added.

A draft of new carbon regulation legislation, which has been worked out over the last four years, does not include a carbon tax or a national emissions trading system, after heavy lobbying from industry, he noted.

Russia joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in September 2019, but its current climate policies and targets are way out of line with the pact's goal to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times, according to research coalition Climate Action Tracker.

Russia's draft long-term low-carbon development strategy, due to be approved this year, is considered by many experts as unambitious, as it does not foresee reaching carbon-neutrality any time before mid-century.

The country's first emissions target under the Paris Agreement, approved by President Vladimir Putin last November, aims for a minimum 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels, including the carbon stored in and released from forests and other ecosystems.

But Russia's emissions are already about 30% lower than 1990 levels, without taking forests into account, and just over 50% lower if they are included.

The economy ministry also said in late 2020 the focus for near-term climate policy would be energy efficiency measures, incentives and support for companies to invest in emissions-cutting projects, and an updated methodology to measure forest carbon.

Plans, announced last month, set a new target to increase energy efficiency by 30% from 2019 levels by 2030, after a previous 2020 goal was missed by a long way.

The new target will enable Russia to reduce its carbon emissions by almost half by 2030 from current levels, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Ilya Torosov told journalists.

Alexey Kokorin, director of WWF-Russia's climate and energy programme, said the Sakhalin experiment was possible because oil and gas companies in the region, including Shell, are keen to shrink their carbon footprint and start producing carbon-neutral LNG as part of the Sakhalin-2 project by purchasing offsets.

""The experiment is certainly good, but Russia also needs to reconsider its national emissions reduction target and make its climate commitments more ambitious,"" he added.",,"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russia-aims-make-sakhalin-island-carbon-neutral-by-2025-2021-06-02/

Achieving ‘net zero carbon’ (or being ‘carbon neutral’) aims to ‘balance’ emissions by cutting them where we can, and introducing measures to prevent those emissions that we cannot avoid from entering the atmosphere. This is called ‘offsetting’ emissions.""

""Zero emissions would mean no production of any greenhouse gas emissions at all. There are some sectors (e.g. farming and aviation) where it is anticipated this will not be possible. Net zero therefore allows for a small amount of residual emissions to be produced but requires the UK to find so called ‘negative emissions technologies’ which can take carbon out of the atmosphere to compensate. These measures can include planting trees, rewilding and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. It is important to note that the vast majority of city-level emissions will not be in the ‘too difficult to cut’ bucket which will be netted off""

the world committed to bold action on climate

refers to achieving net zero GHG emissions,
through reducing emissions as much as possible
and then balancing remaining emissions with
carbon removal or carbon offset programs"," In evaluating interim targets for 2030, the
City compared its emissions forecasts against
different target options to understand the scale
of reductions needed from the CECAP actions,
and then selected an interim target that balances
the City’s ambition with the realities of Dallas’
relatively high level of emissions in its base year.
A common approach used by cities is to
set interim targets based on a straight-line
trajectory from their base year to their longterm goal. Figure 16 shows this trajectory
from the 2015 emissions base year to
carbon neutrality by 2050. In Dallas, this

1. Establecer una hoja de ruta para lograr una metrópoli carbono
neutral a más tardar en 2050.
2. Definir cómo la metrópoli se adaptará y mejorará su resiliencia
a los riesgos relacionados con el clima.
3. Informar a la ciudadanía sobre su desarrollo y avance en implementación, presentando los beneficios esperados y alcanzados, asegurando su distribución equitativa.4 una mejor calidad de vida, principalmente de aquellos que se encuentran en zonas más vulnerables
ante los riesgos climáticos. Adicionalmente, una planificación urbana
resiliente y sostenible trae consigo importantes co-beneficios, ya que
hacen de la metrópoli un lugar seguro y sustentable para sus habitantes.

Increase use of public transport: Banjarmasin has nine Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) fleets that pass through 2 corridors. The current number of corridors is smaller than the ideal number of 13 corridors if all villages in Banjarmasin are to be covered. The addition of corridors is constrained by a limited local budget (APBD). In addition to BRT, the Banjarmasin government also provides free bus services of 20 buses, of which 15 are for students and 5 are for disabled groups. This free service gets a budget of Rp 1.2 billion (USD 0.08 million) per year.

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

The City also brought together an informal Equity Stakeholder Working Group to provide feedback and guidance on the development of the CEI. From their feedback, the City recognizes that areas with very low, low, and moderate access to opportunity face the largest barriers and should be prioritized. Staff recommends designating these census tracts as Communities of Concern. 
Working with community-based organizations, the City has defined climate equity as efforts addressing historical inequities suffered by people of color, allowing everyone to fairly share the same benefits and burdens from climate solutions and attain full and equal access to opportunities regardless of one’s background and identity.

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

In July, 81 sub-national governments announced the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration and launched the Korean Local Governments’ Action Alliance for Carbon-Neutrality with an aim to bolster local governments’ leading role and spread the momentum of carbon neutrality and climate change action through collaboration. And, on the occasion of the P4G Seoul Summit, all 243 local governments will announce the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Joint Declaration for the first time in the world. With the joint declaration, all local governments of Korea will join hands to take a pivotal role in achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change. Minister Jeon Hae-cheol stressed that “Through participation and cooperation of local governments and residents, inclusive green recovery and sustainable economic innovation can be achieved at the same time, while realizing the vision for carbon neutrality.” “The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will give full support to explore and carry out innovative projects for promoting sustainable development and carbon neutrality in local governments,” he added.

Direct GHG emissions (scope 1): The reporting of the direct scope 1 emissions is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and covers all direct emissions of greenhouse gases from Ørsted: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur hexaflouride. The direct carbon emissions from the thermal heat and power plants are determined on the basis of the fuel quantities used in accordance with the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS scheme are, for the most part, calculated as energy consumptions multiplied by emission factors.

Indirect GHG emissions (scope 2): The reporting of the indirect scope 2 emissions is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and includes the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of power, heat, and steam purchased and consumed by Ørsted. The scope 2 emissions are primarily cal- culated as the power volumes purchased multiplied by country-specific emission factors. Location-based is calculated based on average emission factors for each country, whereas market-based takes the green power purchased into account and assumes that the non-green power is delivered as residual power where the green part has been taken out.

Greenhouse gas emissions, scope 3: The scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are reported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol which divides the scope 3 inventory into 15 subcategories (C1-C15).

The Board of Directors approves the sustainability targets in the corporate strategy and monitors that they are achieved and approves the annual sustainability report.

This begins with a strong focus on our own production sites, where we aim to reduce our carbon footprint by 65 percent by 2025 and by 75 percent by 2030 (base year 2010). To do so, we continually check and improve our energy efficiency, and set the target to reduce energy consumption at our production sites by 50 percent per ton of product by 2030 compared to the base year 2010.

'Another successful step along our road to net-zero emissions was working collaboratively with different areas of the business to put an internal price on carbon. Essentially, we allocate carbon costs across each operational function—for example, our data centers or office buildings—which means they are responsible for their emissions.

Water UK’s Net Zero 2030 Routemap is 20 years ahead of the UK Government’s own legally binding target of 2050 and forms the world’s first detailed plan to get an entire industry sector to net zero.
https://www.unitedutilities.com/corporate/newsroom/latest-news/united-utilities-plans-for-net-zero-carbon-by-2030/",For North West England the first milestone along the Routemap is 2021 when the water and wastewater service provision for all 7 million United Utilities customers will be powered by green energy.,"The 2018-19 reference baseline for the sector has been produced using the water companies CAW data for that year.

We will reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 63%
from our 2015 baseline by 2030 – this represents
our direct operational emissions and our emissions
from electricity use. This target has been ratified
by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an
independent global body formed by the United
Nations Global Compact, CDP, the World Resources
Institute and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature.
The SBTi assesses and approves companies’
targets through a scientific lens, ensuring
alignment with the Paris Agreement goal
of limiting climate change to an increase
of 1.5 degrees above pre‑industrial levels.
To achieve this target globally, it is forecast that
net positive carbon emissions will be required.
This is why we have set our 2050 (or earlier)
goal, encompassing scope 1 and 2 emissions,
to go beyond net zero.
Our ambition is to remove more emissions from
the atmosphere than we are responsible for. Our
strategies to achieve this will continue to evolve
over this time horizon and will be communicated
in our sustainability updates and annual reports.
Our main sources of scope 1 (direct) emissions
include emissions from fugitive synthetic
refrigerants, natural gas, transport fuel, stationary
LPG and diesel for onsite back‑up generators,
while our scope 2 (indirect) emissions are those
associated with electricity use. Purchased electricity
represents 82% of our combined scope 1 and 2
emissions, in F21 accounting for 1.91 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2
e). The next
most significant category being refrigerant gases.
This year, we emitted over 2.31 million tonnes of
CO2
e from facilities across the Group (scope 1 and
2 emissions). Positively, our current emissions are
27% below our 2015 baseline. This continues our
positive trend on emission reductions on both an
absolute basis as well as an intensity measure.
We intend to reduce our scope 3 emissions by
19% from our 2015 baseline. These represent
the emissions in our value chain. Our scope 3
emissions include fuel consumption by our logistics
transport, business travel and home delivery and
trolley collection services. Our value chains are

Moody’s achieved carbon neutrality for the first time in 2019 and is dedicated to remaining carbon neutral on an annual basis by
mitigating emissions, as set by our science-based targets, and purchasing verified carbon offsets for residual emissions from our
operations, employee commuting and business travel. In addition, Moody’s intends to retroactively offset our GHG emissions
from September 2000, when Moody’s became a public company, to December 2018. This will be completed through verified
carbon offsets that are matched to each of the historical year’s estimated emissions.
In addition, Moody’s supports carbon-offset projects that provide co-benefits such as biodiversity through forestry projects and
promote financial prosperity in communities where we operate. We select carbon offset projects based on the optimal
alignment and support of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including forestation offsets, clean cookstoves or
water boreholes, and clean energy. In 2021, Moody’s intends to maximize our purchase of carbon offsets in alignment with the

by 2030 Microsoft will remove more carbon than it emits, setting us on a path to remove by 2050 all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975. We will achieve this through a portfolio of negative emission technologies (NET) potentially including afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs), and direct air capture (DAC).
Microsoft will form its carbon removal portfolio annually by assessing NET attributes pertaining to four criteria: (1) scalability; (2) affordability; (3) commercial availability and (4) verifiability. Given the current state of technology and pricing, we will initially focus on nature-based solutions, with the goal of shifting to technology-based solutions between now and 2050, when they become more viable.

In a world racing to reach Net Zero, ENGIE wants to set the pace for decarbonization of the energy industry.

This long-term ambition is complemented by intermediary targets for 2025 and 2030 and the commitment to maintain a trajectory compatible with well below 2°C.

Emissions related to energy generation and sales represent roughly 85% of ENGIE’s carbon footprint. Achieving Net Zero by 2045 will require a massive switch to decarbonized energy generation and green energy sales.

The procurement of goods and services accounts for 13% of ENGIE’s total footprint remains poorly understood. ENGIE had already set an objective of having all preferred suppliers with Science Based Targets by 2030 compared to 15% today. However, achieving net zero by 2045 will require engaging suppliers on a much greater scale.

Reporting taking place twice a year 
Although put that the entity has a public plan, this is not as comprehensive a plan as others. There are documents stating targets concerning carbon emissions, but there is a lack of information about how to reach those emissions reductions specifically and lack of numbers around the GHG emissions reductions these would cause. In their net zero plan, they appear to have broken it down into carbon, water, food waste, plastics and recycling, healthy and sustainable diets and biodiversity. These are all important areas for wider sustainability and some will definitely contribute to emissions reductions, but they lack a clear link to emissions reductions with the only real reference to how these are linked to climate action is the UN's Sustainable Development Goal icon for climate action. Some do have concrete goals i.e. ""increasing the percentage of its fleet using alternative zero and low carbon fuels to 20% by 2025"". However on the whole, the plan lacks a cohesive concrete assessment of the whole emissions scope of the entity.

third parties, which means they are real, additional and independently verified. We also strive to source offset credits that are
generated from projects located in areas where JPMorgan Chase has a presence, and that have additional co-benefits.

i) ending financial services to power generation customers with over 10% of revenues coming from thermal coal by 2030; and 
ii)cutting our exposure to thermal coal mining to zero by 2030.

in april 2021, we became a founding member of the net zero banking alliance (under the united nations environment programme finance initiative). it sets out to:
i) transition operational and attributable greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions from lending and investment portfolios towards pathways to net-zero by mid-century.
ii) set intermediate targets for 2030 (or sooner) in respect of priority ghg-emitting sectors.
iii) prioritize client engagement with products and services that facilitate their needed transition in the real economy.

According to the company, this approach led to an increase of its total emissions in 2020 from 27.38 to 33.3 MtCO2e, of which 8.0 MtCO2e are scope 1, 0.2 MtCO2e scope 2 (market-based) and 25.0 MtCO2e scope 3 emissions.

Information on contentious nature of offsetting projects involving Deutsche Post DHL:
Deutsche Post has looked for some of the higher quality credits available on the voluntary carbon markets. The company has five minimum criteria for credits, related to third-party monitoring and verification; transparency and the avoidance of double counting; permanence; sustainable development; and leakage. In addition, the company aims to prioritise projects that centre around renewable energy, waste disposal and household appliances; are small and with co-benefits for local communities; and located in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Finally, Deutsche Post states that it prioritises credits with more recent vintage dates over older ones and avoids credits older than five years.150Based on these criteria, Deutsche Post sourced offset credits from seven projects in 2020. Those include wind power projects in Aruba and in India, cookstove projects in Guatemala and Lesotho, a landfill gas project in Chile, and a biogas programme in Vietnam.151 The cookstove project in Lesotho was solely funded by Deutsche Post DHL and all projects are Gold Standard verified.152 All of these project types represent some of the higher quality ones available in recent years. Unlike the majority of projects that supply current voluntary carbon markets, there is a fair chance that these seven projects depend on revenue for continuation and that the support provided by Deutsche Post leads to some additional climate impact. However, in the context global governance framework of the Paris Agreement, which requires all countries to set ambitious emission reduction targets, the additionality of these types of projects is contentious, as they may be accessible to host countries and could be part of host countries’ own GHG emission abatement efforts. As such, the projects are not a credible equivalent to the reduction of Deutsche Post DHL’s own emissions. The same is true for the eight projects that Deutsche Post DHL selected in early 2022. https://newclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CorporateClimateResponsibilityMonitor2022.pdf",,,70900000000,,Transportation services,,499461,,,,

achieve carbon neutrality within our operations by 2030.
This target includes existing operations and extends to all
future operations, including acquisitions.
We recognise the urgency needed to reduce emissions
during this critical decade and despite our continued
growth and expansion, we will reduce our net operational
emissions from our FY20 baseline by at least three per
cent annually and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.
The contribution of our Eliwana and Iron Bridge projects
means we will effectively reduce our net emissions to
50 per cent below our projected business-as-usual
unmitigated emissions by FY25 from our FY20 baseline.
The first half of the decade will see emission reductions
achieved predominantly through the increased use of
renewable energy to power our sites. We will use offsets
to address residual emissions where economically
viable decarbonisation opportunities and technologies
are unavailable. Their use will be consistent with the
mitigation hierarchy to avoid, reduce and offset emissions.
Where the technology required to decarbonise our mining
fleet is not readily available, we are making significant
investments in research and development and partnering
with others to develop the technology needed to advance
in these areas.
Carbon
neutrality
by 2030
Scope 3 emissions
We are engaging with stakeholders and investing in
solutions that can reduce emissions beyond our own
operations into hard-to-abate sectors.
Through FFI, we intend to:
• Supply over 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen
annually by 2030 as renewable hydrogen becomes the
most globally traded seaborne energy commodity in
the world.
• Progress technical solutions that use green hydrogen
and green ammonia to decarbonise iron and steel
making and international cargo shipping.
We support the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, which mandates that individual
nations take responsibility for emissions within their own
borders. Despite the logistical challenges of reducing
Scope 3 emissions that are beyond our operational
control, in collaboration with our customers we will
develop and trial technologies to enable the reduction
of emissions from steel making and work to reduce the
emissions intensity from the shipping of our iron ore.
Setting stretch targets is a core Fortescue Value and we
continuously review our targets and Climate Change
Strategy to ensure they remain consistent with new
technologies, climate policies, evolving stakeholder
expectations and our maturing understanding of physical
and transitional risks.","
The contribution of our Eliwana and Iron Bridge projects means we will effectively reduce our net emissions to 50 per cent below our projected business-as-usual unmitigated emissions by FY25 from our FY20 baseline (2.074MtCO2e) .

reduce emissions before using offsets. We will only use
offsets to abate residual emissions where economically
viable decarbonisation opportunities and technologies are
unavailable at the scale or within the timeframes required
to reduce operational emissions in line with our targets.
To manage the risks of offsets sourcing, the CCC has
developed principles that:
• Ensure our offsetting activities effectively manage
reputational risks and prioritises decarbonisation
that is consistent with the objectives of the Paris
Agreement.
• Prioritise high quality offset options with co-benefits
that create additional value for us, as well as local
stakeholders.
• Ensure a risk-based appraisal and consider sourcing
offsets from both public and private markets.
• Align with the Code of Best Practice developed by the
International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance
(ICROA).
Fortescue was founded on the belief that communities
should benefit from our success, and we will give
preference to offsets that provide biodiversity, social and
economic benefits to the communities where we operate.
We will adhere to the following offset selection criteria
to ensure only offsets that meet a high standard are
sourced:
• Real: result in a net reduction of emissions.
• Measurable: result in measurable reductions,
supported by evidence.
• Permanent: result in a permanent reduction in
emissions.
• Additional: would not have happened in the absence of
the revenue associated with the transaction of carbon
credits.
• Independently verified: verified by an independent
third-party auditor using best practice standards and
methodologies.
• Unique: only counted once and not claimed by another
entity.
• Current: to the extent possible, abatement occurs
within the same period that emissions were generated.
The CCC is also evaluating opportunities to directly invest
in offset generation projects that can contribute towards
our emission reduction objectives. ",,,12900000000,,Materials,,779,,,,

WesCEF recognises it has a role to play in addressing climate change and reducing its carbon footprint for current and future generations. WesCEF has always been an early adopter of emissions reduction technology. The installation of catalysts in its nitric acid plants from 2011 has resulted in a significant reduction in emissions. In the 2021 financial year, 742,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions were avoided using this technology. As the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the Wesfarmers Group, WesCEF currently emits approximately 880,000 tonnes a year of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, primarily from its Chemicals businesses. Reducing WesCEF's Carbon Footprint WesCEF aspires to net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050, which it aims to achieve through investment in research, technology, energy and transport efficiency, and process optimisation. To ensure climate change is coordinated and managed across WesCEF, a Climate Change Policy was introduced this year, along with the formation of a dedicated Climate Opportunities team to lead the organisation’s development of a roadmap to achieve WesCEF’s emissions reduction target. Wide consultation with key internal and external stakeholders will inform the roadmap and when complete, the roadmap will guide WesCEF’s focus on abatement efforts. At present, no known cost-effective technologies exist for WesCEF to attain net zero emissions while maintaining Wesfarmers’ objective of providing a satisfactory return to shareholders. However, WesCEF also recognises there is considerable investment and innovation with respect to climate change and it expects rapid technology development in the coming years. As a result, the roadmap will be a living document that will evolve as technology develops. A range of climate change initiatives are also either underway or being investigated, including: becoming a founding member of the Australian Energy Transition Initiative, which involves other industrial giants as well as banks, superannuation companies and not-for-profit organisations, aiming to develop pathways and actions that can accelerate emissions reductions across whole supply chains sponsoring CSIRO research into carbon capture and utilisation options continuing to improve the abatement catalysts in our nitric acid plants which convert greenhouse gases into passive, inactive gases that are safe for the environment, to limit nitrous oxide emissions. To further understand its complete carbon footprint, WesCEF is expanding its reporting around Scope 3 emissions.

used to try and measure the alignment of a portfolio or an
asset class with the Paris agreement, i.e to limit global warming
to below 2°C by 2100 compared to preindustrial levels. The
data lacks robustness and is still being adjusted with models
and methodologies that are improving regularly. Rather than
the absolute level of portfolio temperature, SCOR prefers to
consider the trend. As in the past, SCOR has selected
Carbon 4(1) for this assessment. According to the 2020 model
changes implemented by Carbon 4(2), the measurement is
stable year on year at 2.8°C (would have been stable at 3.1°C
before changes in methodologies). ","As a member of the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance,
SCOR has committed to setting targets for the decarbonization
of its portfolio. The baseline is end of year 2019 and the target
is set over a five year time horizon, running until the end of 2024.
SCOR believes that the carbon footprint is more meaningful
when taking scope 3 (other indirect emissions(3)) into account
and that carbon intensive sectors are the ones for which scope 3
matters most. For these reasons and despite some weaknesses in
the current data, SCOR has decided to set Carbon Intensity
targets including scope 3 for its corporate bond and equities
sub-portfolio based on the Enterprise Value of issuers.
SCOR commits to reducing its carbon intensity by 27% by
end of 2024 for corporate bonds and equities sub-portfolios.
This will be achieved by combining a best- in- class selection
with active engagement with investees, in order to impact the real
economy. The decarbonization path cannot be achieved by rebalancing the highest emitting sectors to the least emitting ones;
with no consideration in terms of supporting companies with

emissions were 16,391 kt CO2-e, a decrease of
eight per cent on FY2021, and 10 per cent lower
than our FY2017 baseline.
Our total Scope 3 emissions reported
under our SBTi-approved emissions reduction
target increased by four per cent in FY2021 to
22,347 kt CO2-e, and were 19 per cent lower
than our FY2017 baseline, largely reflecting lower
output from our owned and contracted generation
resulting in an increase in net electricity purchases
from the NEM and external sources, partly offset
by a reduction in domestic gas sales at Australia
Pacific LNG primarily due to the roll off of legacy
contracts. Further details are provided in the
following section.

The world is rapidly accelerating towards a
lower-emissions future, and we will play an
important role in that transition. We will help
bring to bear the energy and technologies needed
to meet decarbonisation goals, not just for the
energy sector, but also for other sectors across
the economy.

emissions target to 2022
Net zero emissions refers to achieving
an overall balance between greenhouse
gases emitted in operation and
greenhouse gases removed from the
atmosphere. Getting Dexus to net
zero is an opportunity to align with
changing customer sentiment and
meet the increasing investor demands
for low-carbon investments.
We have made great progress on our
goal already and have brought forward
our target to achieve net zero emissions
to 30 June 2022, advancing our original
2030 goal by eight years. Accelerating
our net zero ambition delivers strong
climate action for our planet, enhances
our vision and customer proposition
for smart, sustainable workspaces
and ensures we will be ready for other
opportunities, including supporting our
customers on their own journey.
Our commitment to deliver net zero
emissions by 30 June 2022 will be
achieved by:
1. Our transition to 100% renewable
electricity from base building
operations from July 2021, purchasing
renewable energy in the form of
Large-scale Generation Certificates
or GreenPower
2. Continuing to invest in certified
carbon offsets for our remaining
emissions. We will purchase
accredited nature-based offsets to
account for emissions from natural
gas, wastewater, refrigerants, and
waste/recycling
3. Verifying we are net zero and
maintaining this status through
Australia’s Climate Active carbon
neutral program
In parallel with this transition, our focus
remains on improving energy efficiency
and accelerating the deployment of
on-site renewables (see pages 56-57).
Transitioning to 100% renewable
electricity will account for around
80% of scope 2 and 3 emissions, with
the remaining 20% of scope 1 and 3
emissions to be balanced through
carbon offsets.
This includes emissions for the base
building sources comprising electricity,
natural gas, diesel, refrigerant leakage,
water and wastewater, and waste and
recycling. It excludes tenant sources
such as tenancy electricity.
Enriched Environment continued
Our approach on this journey involves:
– Reducing or eliminating emissions at
source through efficiency practices and
emission-free energy
– Investing locally, prioritising Australianbased projects with a geographic
correlation to the location of our
properties to support those local
communities
– Being transparent and verifiable, by
investing in certified renewable energy
and offset schemes, and certifying
and disclosing our outcomes with
independent verification
– Making a difference in Australia’s
transition, by supporting supply chains
and the development of renewable
energy and abatement projects
In line with the Oxford Offsetting Principles,
published by the University of Oxford,
we will shift towards ‘nature-based’
carbon removal projects over emission

to actively reduce atmospheric carbon
dioxide. Initially we will invest in carbon

offsetting these emissions, Wheaton will be focused on engaging
with mining partners to drive down these emissions in order to

Description. Drive a 10% reduction in our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2020 to 2030.
Baseline. Progress measured as percent reduction from our calendar year 2019 emissions. Our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in 2019 were 2.88 million metric tons of CO2e.
Progress in 2021. During 2021, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by approximately 14% from the 2019 baseline.
Looking Ahead. In 2022, we will continue to take action to reduce emissions through abatement, investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation.
In addition to this 2030 goal, in April 2022 we announced a new commitment to reach net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2040.

A more streamlined framework allows us to better assess risk within our portfolio as a result of changing regulation and market demand during a shift to a low carbon economy. Following the conclusion of this work, we made two major changes 1) combining our environmental policy with our relationship review oversight policy and 2) designed a climate risk working group. These changes better streamlined environmental risk into our well defined relationship risk process, allowing an integrated approach to management, and the climate risk working group will streamline communications around climate risk to address risks and opportunities at an enterprise level instead of one off. Increasing temperatures caused by climate change have the potential to significantly increase the cost to power U.S. Bank’s over 3,000 locations. We need to manage physical climate change risks and opportunities through rigorous energy efficiency programs and have done this through building upgrades.

• We are targeting a 35% reduction in the operational emissions intensity of our oil and gas portfolio compared to a 2020 base

• We are targeting a 27% reduction in the end use emissions intensity of our oil and gas portfolio compared to a 2020 base year,
including Scope 3 emissions from the combustion of hydrocarbon-derived fuels sold into the market.

CIBC has established an interim target to reduce the financed emissions associated with our power generation portfolio. We are
targeting an emissions intensity of 156 kgCO2 /MWh associated with direct Scope 1 emissions from power generation activities
by 2030, which represents a 32% reduction in emissions intensity compared to our 2020 base year. Our target includes portfolio

and deliver electricity and may purchase electricity – via wholesale power purchases and power purchase agreements, or PPAs –
to meet customer demand. As clients are increasingly incorporating purchased electricity into their climate targets and transition
planning, CIBC believes including Scope 3 emissions from purchased power more comprehensively captures the role utilities
can play in decarbonizing the power market. As data quality and reporting improves, CIBC intends to include the option of
incorporating Scope 3 emissions from purchased power into the power sector portfolio calculations. Scope 2 emissions resulting
from electricity used to operate power generation facilities are excluded from our target, as these emissions are not material.

UOB has set out emissions targets in six carbon-intensive sectors it finances in order to meet its net-zero emissions commitments by 2050, the second bank in the region to do so. The six sectors UOB is targeting are power, automotive, oil and gas, which are part of the energy value chain, as well as real estate, construction and steel, which are part of the built environment value chain.
This 2050 goal will be met by cutting financing to new upstream gas and oil projects and setting emissions reduction goals in other sectors, among other things. In addition, UOB has committed to exit financing for the thermal coal sector by 2039.

For the other five sectors, the bank has set interim emissions reduction goals for 2030 and net-zero targets by 2050. UOB has also set targets to reduce emissions intensity for these five sectors.

Emissions intensity is measured differently for each sector. For example, in the power sector, it is measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide produced per megawatt-hour of energy. For the power sector, the bank has set a goal to reduce emissions intensity by 61 per cent by 2030 and by 98 per cent by 2050.",Yes,"Information on the extent to which measures will be applied (e.g. if switching to EVs, what share of the fleet; if installing an own solar PV installation, what is the installed capacity)",Annual reporting,No,Not Specified,,Yes,Not include avoided emissions (e.g. via renewable energy projects),,,No,No,,,,12000000000,,Services,,26872,,,,

management teams worked collaboratively toward these goals, implementing realistic and economically
feasible projects to reduce the company’s carbon footprint, such as building equipment retrofits, data centre optimizations
and operational enhancements. Between 2013 and 2017, the company achieved a 17.7 per cent reduction in GHG emissions
in its managed real estate portfolio.""

assets by 2020 (Scope 1 and 2) and to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in absolute GHG emissions from energy use at
owned assets by 2036 (Scope 1 and 2). Thanks to its various energy efficiency projects underway and its strategy of

Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of performance against those targets...
... Since the TEPCO Group transferred its fuel and thermal power business to JERA in April 2019, our Scope 1 emissions are now extremely low at 203,000 tons. However, greenhouse gas emissions during the retail sale of power, which account for the majority of Scope 3 emissions, must be estimated and reported in accordance with the Law Concerning the Promotion of the Measures to Cope with Global Warming. Therefore, the TEPCO Group has set a target of reducing CO2 emissions originating from the sale of power by 50% (of 
FY2013 levels) by the year FY2030. CO2 emissions in FY2013 were 139.2 million tons. By promoting the use of renewable energies and procured electricity from highly efficient thermal power stations, in FY2020 we were able to reduce this amount to 83.6 million tons (quick estimate), which corresponds to approximately 80% of our target. We will continue to further promote the use of renewable energies and recommence operation of nuclear power stations in order to achieve our target.

In its sustainability report, the company states that it does not track enteric and manure emissions from live animal operations and only reports on enteric fermentation from animals on its own feedlots and farms, omitting feedlots and farms that JBS does not own but are part of its supply chain. In addition, the company does not report on deforestation emissions resulting from its operations. JBS’s entire emissions footprint is estimated at 280MtCO2e; yet the company reports less than 3% of this.","S1&2: -30% by 2030, from 2019. Unclear if absolute or intensity target.","JBS' overall net zero target is clearly outlined, however current publications of emissions neglect an extreme amount of wider scope emissions from livestock practices which are within the supply chain, but not directly JBS owned. This reduces confidence in the net zero claim, depending on the baseline emissions from which net zero will be achieved. The Interim targets are uncertain, but aim for a 30% reduction in either intensity, or absolute emissions by 2030 from 2019 levels. JBS is projecting future growth into a very carbon-intense market, which is coupled by very little detail beyond the headline claims.

",Not Specified,,,,Yes,Not Specified," In its communication on its net zero target, JBS says that it wants to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions, while offsetting residual emissions. The company does not have a reduction target accompanying its net-zero headline pledge. It is therefore unclear what share of JBS’s emissions footprint will be offset by 2040. Given the limited detail on emission reduction measures and the expected continuous growth  the company, this share could be significant. JBS does not specify any details regarding what kind of offsetting projects it will procure credits from, the potential volume of credits it envisages needing, nor general criteria for ensuring robust environmental integrity in any offsetting claims it may make.

Overall, claims made for offsetting, as well as drive for 100% renewables by 2040, however there is very little detail on how this will become tangible, as well as continued uncertainty about the actual magnitude of emissions which JBS considers its own and therefore is pledging to offset.

CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE: CBRE) today announced its commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. This commitment encompasses carbon emissions from CBRE’s own operations and the properties it manages for investors and occupiers, as well as indirect supply chain emissions.

“As the world’s largest manager of commercial real estate, we have a special obligation to help the world address the many challenges posed by the warming planet,” said Bob Sulentic, CBRE’s president and chief executive officer. “CBRE is deeply committed to doing our part and to working with our clients and across our vast global supply chain to help achieve net zero emissions as quickly as possible. This is an essential element of our commitment to the communities in which we operate.”

As a part of its 2040 net-zero emissions strategy, CBRE today signed The Climate Pledge, a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon 10 years ahead of the goal stated in the Paris Agreement. The Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism, forms a cross-sector community of companies and organizations committed to net zero carbon by 2040, working together to take action to address the climate crisis and solve the challenges of decarbonizing our economy.
The net zero commitment builds on the company’s science-based emissions reduction target announced last year.

The Group also continues efforts to reach its “zero waste” goal, increasing circular business model practices and reviewing its processes.

","Sabancı Holding CEO Cenk Alper, speaking to CNBC Europe, underlined that Sabancı Group has a pioneering mission in sustainability with its commitment of net zero emissions by 2050 and said: “We should have science based-targets for each year, we have to reach half of the goals by 2030.”

Sabancı Holding CEO Cenk Alper joined the ""Squawk Box Europe"" program on CNBC Europe and evaluated Sabancı Holding's sustainability goals. Sabancı Holding CEO Cenk Alper stated that he sees sustainability as an integral part of the Group's purpose and strategy. Mr. Alper also shared Sabancı Holding's sustainability goals and the Group's sustainability roadmap with the audience.

“We unite Turkey and the world for a sustainable life with leading enterprises”

Mr. Alper said: “Last year we revised our Group’s common purpose as: ‘We unite Turkey and the world for a sustainable life with leading enterprises.’ We have also prepared a 5-year strategic plan based on the findings of a comprehensive study we conducted across our entire Group to foresee the post-pandemic world. This plan includes 5 strategic directions that we believe will lead us to our Group’s goal: Provide wider customer experience, transform into an agile global/local footprint, pioneer in sustainability, lead in digital & material technologies and adapt to future of work. In addition, as the Group, we announced our long-term sustainability goals by committing to reach 'Net Zero Emissions’ by 2050.”

“We have drawn different roadmaps for all our group activities”

Sabancı Holding CEO Cenk Alper said that some solutions needed for net zero emissions and zero waste are not yet technologically possible: “We have drawn a long roadmap, we want to implement it. Within the group, we analyzed all our group activities and drew different roadmaps for each and single entity. Some of these goals and activities towards zero carbon emissions are clear now, but if the necessary solution is not available in the world, we will join the worldwide networks to find the necessary solutions. We plan to achieve half of our goals by 2030. We talk about this at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We need to set our goals on a science-based year basis, we have to reach half of our goals by 2030, otherwise we will miss the 2050 target.” https://www.sabanci.com/en/news-detail/we-have-to-reach-half-of-our-sustainability-goals-by-2030",,https://www.sabanci.com/en/news-detail/sabanci-holding-leads-sustainability-with-its-zero-emission-goal,Carbon dioxide and other GHGs,,,,,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,No,,No,,No reporting mechanism,No,No,,Not Specified,,,,No,Not Specified,,,,10700000000,,Services,,64294,,,,

Newcrest sets goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050
Newcrest’s Purpose is “To create a brighter future for people through safe and responsible mining”.
This Purpose underpins our commitment to take on the challenge of climate change and to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions.
Our goal is net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Newcrest is taking action to manage climate change risks and opportunities.
In June 2019, we released our Climate Change Policy which outlined our commitment to the sustainable discovery,
development and production of gold and copper, together with our plans to identify, assess and report our responses to climate
change challenges.
This Policy continues to direct our actions to build a sustainable, resilient business which will thrive in a low carbon future,
encompassing:
• a better understanding of the life-cycle GHG emissions for the gold and copper value chains
• increasing the transparency of our climate change reporting of performance metrics and targets
• reporting our energy use, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and our performance against targets annually
• working with our suppliers and customers to better understand our Scope 3 emissions
• ensuring that our measuring, reporting and verification processes are robust across all operating sites
• assessing options to increase our use of renewable power and low emission energy technologies
• focusing on opportunities to improve our energy efficiency to reduce energy used and reduce direct mining costs
• identifying and pursuing best practices in the mining and metals industry and partner with technology developers
• assessing climate change scenarios and the projected future price of energy in our medium to long term portfolio
analysis
• partnering with experts and research organisations to identify potential physical threats from climate change at our
current and planned operating sites and invest in appropriate adaptation responses to build resilience
• contributing constructively to policy development in our host countries.
In June 2019 we also set a target to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 against our FY18 baseline.
We are making progress.
• We have developed GHG Management Plans for each operating site to understand the abatement opportunities.
• We have directly linked achievement of the actions detailed in these plans to senior executive incentive payments.
• We are progressively improving the measurement of our GHG emissions across our full value chain.
• We are increasing our use of renewable sources of energy. For example, we have entered an agreement to purchase
40% of the energy requirements of our Cadia operation from a wind farm which is expected to be generating from
2024.
• We are well advanced in assessing the risks and opportunities for our business under selected climate change
scenarios in line with the Paris Agreement goals.
Newcrest now wishes to set a new longer-term goal, which is to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal will apply
to our operational (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions.
We will also continue working across our value chain to reduce Scope 3 emissions.
We will continue to be guided by our Climate Change Policy as we pursue this.
Our energy and emissions performance is reported in our Sustainability Reports and we support the Taskforce on Climaterelated Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations for reporting climate change risks and opportunities.","Climate change update

In addition, we launched our Bitcoin Clean Energy Investment Initiative to help accelerate renewable energy adoption in bitcoin mining.  Our Scope 3 footprint is 98% of our total carbon footprint and tracks everything from emission calculations attributed to our credit card processing to energy consumption by Square sellers using our hardware. 
“Committing to be a net zero carbon contributor is consistent with our purpose of economic empowerment, as we’ll continue to work for our customers without contributing to longer-term climate issues,” said Square Chief Financial Officer, Amrita Ahuja. “Endangering the environment will ultimately disproportionately endanger underserved communities around the world.”

To push boundaries, we decided to extend Scope 3 with the energy use from our products: the transactions our merchants’ shoppers carry out on POS terminals, online and mobile payments. 

When gathering these results, we decided to include an estimation of increased CO2 emissions coming from our employees’ homes in 2020 and added that to our Scope 3 emissions.

Through investing in sustainable energy projects, we offset our GHG emissions. Our GHG compensation investments resulted in the prevention of millions of tonnes of CO2 being released into the atmosphere. In addition to the positive environmental impact these projects have, we opted for projects touching upon a wide spread of the United Nations’ SDGs – underscoring that we care about all of these. All projects invested in were carefully selected based on the synergies they create between generating renewable energy, reforestation, wildlife protection and advancing socio-economic wellbeing for local communities. This, we believe, fosters true sustainability.

In 2019, we compensated for all greenhouse gases emitted in our operations since our foundation in 2006. We did this by purchasing credits from third-party verified emissions reduction projects - also known as “carbon offsets”. These projects focus on reforestation, generating solar energy and the capturing of methane gases from landfills so they don’t enter the atmosphere. This is just the first step.

The board has ultimate responsibility for risk management, and their decision-making takes climate-related risks into account. In 2019,
we added climate change risk oversight to the charter of the Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility (HES&CR) committee of the board of directors to highlight how seriously we approach robust understanding and evaluation of climate risk. This committee meets at least twice per year to understand and monitor climate-related trends, issues, legislation, policies, practices and concerns.
Our executive vice president of Operations, who reports directly to the CEO, has leadership responsibility for climate-related issues. He provides regular updates to the board regarding performance.
Our vice president of Health, Environment, Safety, Security (HES&S) and Corporate Sustainability, who reports to the executive vice president of Operations, has leadership accountability for driving our corporate sustainability programs. This role provides the strategic focus necessary to align all areas of our corporate ESG strategy and embed sustainability practices into the way we run our business.

• Conversion of existing field gas pneumatic actuated controllers to instrument air or electric-action, permanently reducing methane emissions. Future devices installed on Marathon Oil-owned equipment will be instrument air or electric-action.
• Purchase of renewable energy credits (RECs) to fully offset 2021 Scope 2 emissions created from purchased electricity use.
• Improved gas capture.
• Optimization of compression associated with gas lift

""Driving significant and continuous reductions to our GHG emissions intensity is a core part of our strategy to mitigate the longer-term market risks related to climate change. Our GHG reduction initiatives are supported by transparent, quantitative objectives intended to promote accountability and ingenuity throughout our organization. We believe that our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 goal is more ambitious than the emissions reduction trajectory necessary to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.""

We believe strong corporate governance is foundational to delivering shareholder value, and have modified our executive compensation framework to further align management interests with stakeholders’ interests and to incentivize the behaviors we believe are most important:
• Safety
• GHG emissions intensity reduction
• Capital discipline
• Enterprise breakeven
• Balance sheet/financial performance
In recognition of the importance of these behaviors, several actions were taken related to executive officer compensation. Executive officers saw their base salaries reduced by 10% during 2020 in response to the severe market conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and for 2021, the company reduced annual board compensation by 25% and my total direct compensation by 25% including a 35% reduction to my long-term incentive awards",Yes,No conditions specified,,,No,Yes (unspecified),"""Announced a goal for 2025 to reduce GHG intensity by more than 50% relative to a 2019 baseline. We identified multiple operational and design solutions to achieve this goal, including but not limited to continued replacement of instrument gas pneumatic controllers with lower or non-emitting technologies, connecting additional sites to utility power where feasible and investing in soil carbon sequestration to offset emissions.""

""One example of a beneficial collaboration is our support for soil carbon sequestration by funding a credit development project with Grassroots Carbon, formerly Soil Value Exchange. 
The organization is focused on unlocking the massive carbon storage potential of sustainably grazed pasture and rangelands, which cover over one third of the U.S. and represent an important ecosystem. Marathon Oil’s purchase of verified agricultural soil carbon storage credits through Grassroots Carbon will directly benefit U.S. ranchers who practice regenerative grazing techniques that draw carbon from the atmosphere and restore soil health. This method has the additional benefits of preserving or improving local biodiversity, the soil’s water retention in arid regions, and the quality of water in the watersheds where it’s utilized.
Marathon Oil is interested in using high-quality nature-based carbon credits where they make sense. The Grassroots Carbon credits will be certified under the new BCarbon standard, a scalable soil carbon storage standard designed to work for landowners and carbon storage buyers. In order to deliver soil carbon storage credits of the highest quality, Grassroots Carbon will utilize an internationally-recognized
soil measurement methodology as well as BCarbon’s independent verification and certification requirements.""",,,5100000000,,Fossil Fuels,,2000,,,,

launched our sector’s first Climate
Change Policy in 2007. Our direct
business operations are now carbon
neutral, we procure 100% renewable
electricity in the UK and are the only
homebuilder in the country to be
awarded an A rating for Climate Action
and Transparency by CDP, the highest
score possible.
But we must go further, and Berkeley
is now proud to be a 1.5°C aligned
business, having set independently
verified science-based targets for
reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.
These targets cover our direct emissions,
the embodied carbon within our supply
chain and the in-use emissions created
by our homes.
These targets put us on a course to being
a net zero carbon business by 2040.
We are also playing a lead role in climate
change adaptation, creating new homes
and places that are more resilient to the
challenges of a warmer climate, and
which embrace the great potential of
nature-based solutions.
Our climate action programme is holistic,
ambitious and challenging. It involves
transformational changes to our business
operations and to the ways in which
we design and create new places in
partnership with our supply chain.
We want to play a full role in addressing
this global challenge and believe it
is the right thing to do for all of our
stakeholders. ","In December 2020, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its science-based targets (SBTs) to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:

Berkeley Group commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by FY2030 from a FY2019 base year.
Berkeley Group also commits to reduce scope 3 purchased goods and services and use of sold products GHG emissions 40% per square foot of legally completed floor area over the same timeframe.
These targets represent an ambitious step forward in our approach to tackling climate change and have been calculated to ensure that we play our part in limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

To ensure that we achieve our targets, our focus is on the following:

Reducing gas oil, natural gas and electricity consumption across our construction sites, offices and sales suites (scope 1 and 2 target). Particular emphasis will be placed on minimising or eliminating gas oil usage through the implementation of more fuel efficient plant and its substitution with biodiesels; measures that have been trialled by Berkeley during 2019/20.
Undertaking embodied carbon assessments and working with our supply chain to reduce impact across the most prominent areas (scope 3 target).
Continuing to improve the fabric efficiency of our homes and incorporating low carbon technologies (scope 3 target). We will also look to monitor the in-use performance of our homes to help drive further improvements.
In addition to the above, we continue to procure 100% renewable electricity backed by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) for its UK construction site, office and sales suite activities. This is an action that has been in place since May 2017, along with offsetting our remaining emissions from our direct operations through verified projects to be carbon neutral, which continues on an annual basis.",,https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/media/pdf/f/2/11699_001_Climate_Action_Brochure_A5_v5.pdf,Not Specified,,,,,Yes,Yes,Partial,No,,No,,Annual reporting,No,No,,Yes,No conditions specified,,,No,No,"Our first priority is to reduce our

Over the past three years, the Group’s carbon emissions per full time employee has fallen by 86% to the lowest level in the UK life insurance industry in the FTSE 350. This reduction is due to a broad range of initiatives including a near halving of the property footprint, moving to a renewable energy tariff for purchased electricity, significantly reduced business travel, and a number of facilities improvements and upgrades. Furthermore, the Group is targeting a reduction to net zero in its investment’s portfolio by 2050, with a 50% reduction milestone by 2030, in line with the Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) climate change roadmap, published in July 2021.

To accomplish the challenge of achieving the Zero CO2 emissions from vehicle by 2050, SECOM will take a two-step approach: the radically “reducing” step, and then the completely “eliminating” step. For the “reducing” step, we will first reduce distances traveled by vehicles, enhancing the technology of remote monitoring and promoting operational efficiency. Then we will take measures to replace all 4,000 vehicles to “Top runner vehicles” (next-generation vehicles). For the second “eliminating” step, we will challenge the “Well-to-Wheel” Zero emission for fuels, eliminating CO2 “from the oil field to the tire.”",,,https://www.secom.co.jp/english/csr/infra/environment/warming.html,Not Specified,,,,,Not Specified,Not Specified,Not Specified,No,,Yes,"Information on the extent to which measures will be applied (e.g. if switching to EVs, what share of the fleet; if installing an own solar PV installation, what is the installed capacity)",No reporting mechanism,No,Not Specified,,Not Specified,,,,No,Not Specified,,,,,,Services,,,,,,
